# ZECMailer
ZECMailer is a mass-mailing / payroll application for sending multiple people Zcash transactions with matching amounts and memos.

This is an exercise in making a website in only Vanilla JS. Sorry! Eventually a React version will be ported on top of ZECPages.com - repo located here https://github.com/michaelharms6010/fe-zeitpages/issues

## Future Development
Needed Features:
-Address validity check
-Payment amount validity check
-Other syntax-related error catching


### Warning

This has been very minimally tested! Any reports are appreciated. Contact @michaelharms70 via twitter
